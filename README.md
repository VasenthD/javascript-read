JavaScript Concepts

## Execution Context

Execution context is like a big box that consists of two main components:

### Memory

In the memory, all the variables, values, and functions are stored. This is also referred to as the variable environment.

### Code Component

The code component represents the thread of execution, where the code is executed one line at a time.

JavaScript is SYNCHRONOUS and SINGLE-THREADED COMPONENT.
